## Requirements

- silverstripe/blog: ^3.0@dev
- dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental: ^4@dev

## Installation

`composer require dynamic/silverstripe-elemental-blog`

## Usage

### ElementBlogPosts

A block to show a list of recent posts by a featured blog. Ideal for home pages or dashboards.

### ElementBlogOverview

The purpose of this block is to replicate the output that was originally being given by the Blog module's `Layout`
template.

**Including:**

- Title (including Category/Archive/etc titles)
- Content
- Blog Posts
- Pagination
- Widgets (if the addon as been added and enabled)

You will likely want to override the very basic default template that has been provided, you can do so by overriding the
template found with the namespace `Dynamic\Elements\Blog\Elements\ElementBlogOverview.ss`.

**Please consider:** While the Overview block does support you using it on other page types, it is primarily designed to
be used on Blog page types. This is because it is `Blog` and `BlogController` that provide the relevant info to this
block.

Please consider whether you want this block to be available to other page types, and if you don't, you might want to
add this block as a `disallowed` Element on your other page types. EG:

```yaml
App\Model\Page\MyPage:
  disallowed_elements:
    - Dynamic\Elements\Blog\Elements\ElementBlogOverview
```

If you do wish this block to be available on other page types, then please review the contents on the class to see how
you can dictate what data should be provided through this block.

## ElementBlogPagination

You might decide that you would like Pagination to be displayed quite separately to the Overview block. This can be
achieved by using `ElementBlogPagination` as a separate block.

**Please consider:** Like the Overview Block, please consider removing this block from any/all Page types that you do
not want it available on. EG, if you don't want to use it at all, you can disallow it for all pages by default:

```yaml
Page:
  disallowed_elements:
    - Dynamic\Elements\Blog\Elements\ElementBlogPagination
```

## ElementBlogWidgets

You might decide that you would like Blog Widgets to be displayed quite separately to the Overview. This can be
achieved by using `ElementBlogWidgets` as a separate block.

**Please consider:** Like the Overview Block, please consider removing this block from any/all Page types that you do
not want it available on. EG, if you don't want to use it at all, you can disallow it for all pages by default:

```yaml
Page:
  disallowed_elements:
    - Dynamic\Elements\Blog\Elements\ElementBlogWidgets
```
